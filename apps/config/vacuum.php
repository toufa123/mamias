    | SQL Console
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The console executes statements inside a READ ONLY transaction that is
    | always rolled back. It is disabled by default: enabling it lets an
    | authorized user read every row in your database, which is a decision that
    | should be made deliberately.
    |
    | Read this part carefully, because the guarantee is narrower than it looks.
    | A READ ONLY transaction constrains *this* backend's writes to MVCC storage.
    | It does not constrain a function that opens a second connection, and it does
    | not constrain side effects that happen outside MVCC. All of these begin with
    | SELECT and none of them are stopped by the transaction:
    |
    |     SELECT dblink('dbname=app', 'DELETE FROM users');  -- a second backend
    |     SELECT pg_read_file('/etc/passwd');                -- reads the disk
    |     SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);                  -- kills connections
    |     SELECT lo_export(oid, '/tmp/anywhere');            -- writes a file
    |
    | The thing that actually stops those is the *role*. The console's power is
    | bounded by the privileges of whatever role 'connection' above resolves to,
    | and by nothing else. Point it at a dedicated role that owns nothing, and
    | revoke EXECUTE on the escapes:
    |
    |     CREATE ROLE vacuum_reader LOGIN PASSWORD '...' NOSUPERUSER;
    |     GRANT pg_read_all_stats TO vacuum_reader;
    |     REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_read_file(text), pg_ls_dir(text),
    |         pg_terminate_backend(int), pg_cancel_backend(int),
    |         lo_export(oid, text), lo_import(text) FROM PUBLIC, vacuum_reader;
    |     -- and, if the extensions exist at all:
    |     REVOKE EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public FROM vacuum_reader;
    |
    | With VACUUM_CONNECTION unset, the console runs as your application's own
    | role -- frequently the owner of everything, sometimes a superuser. Vacuum's
    | own statement guard turns away the obvious cases as a courtesy, but a word
    | list is not a security boundary and it is not offered as one.
    |
    | 'timeout' is the per-statement timeout in milliseconds (statement_timeout).
    | 'max_rows' caps the rows and 'max_bytes' caps how much they may weigh, and
    | both are asked of PostgreSQL rather than applied to the answer: the console
    | wraps your statement so the rows past either cap are never produced and
    | never sent. Rows alone were not enough -- three hundred rows of a megabyte
    | each is well inside a cap of five hundred and is three hundred megabytes
    | into a web worker, and 'timeout' cannot stop it because it bounds how long a
    | statement runs rather than how much it hands back.
    |
    | The row that crosses the byte budget is kept, so a cut result is never
    | silently an empty one. A single enormous value is therefore still bounded
    | only by 'timeout' and PHP's memory_limit, as it always was.
